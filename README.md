# summer_reu
Ellie Fassman's Summer 2022 work under Huw Ogilvie. Working in Dr. Luay Nakhleh's lab at Rice University.
Current work is on simulating phylogenetic trees with changing birth, death, and substitution rates (rates change upon a substitution). 
Implementation is modified from the birth_death_tree function in the DendroPy Phylogenetic Computing Library.
