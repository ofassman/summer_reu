Ellie Fassman's Summer 2022 work under Huw Ogilvie. Working in Dr. Luay Nakhleh's lab at Rice University.
Current work is on simulating phylogenetic trees with changing birth, death, and substitution rates (rates change upon a substitution). 
Implementation of this simulator is modified from the birth_death_tree function in the DendroPy Phylogenetic Computing Library.
Additionally, work is being done on approximating the rates that formed phylogenetic trees generated from real genetic sequence data
(using ABC). These approximation methods are also being validated.
